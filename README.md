## Overview

MCP server that wraps the [eToro public API](https://public-api.etoro.com/api/v1), exposing **34 tools** for AI assistants (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code, etc.). Ask Claude to analyze your portfolio, place limit orders, research instruments, discover top traders, and manage watchlists — all in natural language.

## What Can You Do With It?

Below are real conversations with an AI assistant connected to the eToro MCP server.

### Place a limit order

> **You:** Place a buy limit order for 5 SOL if it reaches $75
>
> **Assistant:** Current SOL price is $78.21. I've placed a buy limit order for 5 SOL at $75 ($375 total) with a stop loss at $1. Order confirmed.

---

### DCA ladder based on technical analysis

> **You:** Can you place some DCA buy limit orders for ETH based on key support levels?
>
> **Assistant:** Based on the chart, here are the key support levels for ETH:
>
> - $1,750 — first support zone
> - $1,500 — strong horizontal support
> - $1,200 — macro support
> - $1,000 — psychological floor
>
> I've placed 4 limit orders:
>
> | Level | Amount | ~ETH |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | $1,750 | $1,000 | 0.57 |
> | $1,500 | $1,500 | 1.00 |
> | $1,200 | $2,000 | 1.67 |
> | $1,000 | $2,500 | 2.50 |

---

### Portfolio analysis and average entry price

> **You:** What's my average entry price on SOL including all my positions?
>
> **Assistant:** You have 27 SOL positions totaling **124.62 SOL** with an average entry of **$120.99**.
>
> Including your 4 pending limit orders (39.81 SOL), if all trigger your new average would be **$106.14** on 164.43 SOL.

---

### Market research and opinion

> **You:** What do you think about SUI?
>
> **Assistant:** SUI is trading at **$0.905**, down 75% from its October high of $3.70. Your 4 positions total 3,434 SUI at an average of $1.18 — currently -23%.
>
> **Key levels:** Support at $0.874 and $0.788. Resistance at $1.00 and $1.10.
>
> **Catalysts:** SUI ETF applications under SEC review, SuiPlay0X1 gaming device launching Q3 2026. The $0.78-$0.85 zone is a strong accumulation area.

### Daily market check

> **You:** Check the market related to my portfolio today and tell me if there is some macro news that could explain
>
> **Assistant:**
>
> | Asset | Price | Your Avg Entry | Status |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | **BTC** | $66,455 | ~$68,500 | Underwater on recent buys |
> | **ETH** | $1,948 | ~$2,114 | Recovering |
> | **SOL** | $79.32 | ~$121 | -34% |
> | **SUI** | $0.93 | ~$1.18 | -21% |
> | **LINK** | $8.42 | ~$14.4 | -41% |
>
> **What's driving the selloff:**
>
> 1. CPI report tomorrow — expected +0.3% MoM, still above Fed's 2% target
> 2. Strong US economic data reinforcing "higher for longer" rate narrative
> 3. BTC broke below 365-day moving average for first time since March 2022
> 4. Mixed Spot Bitcoin ETF flows — no institutional conviction
